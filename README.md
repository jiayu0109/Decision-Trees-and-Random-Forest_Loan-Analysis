# Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest_Loan-Analysis
Data Science project: Decision Tree& Random Forest model with Scikit-learn

Using publicly available data from LendingClub.com, this project analyzes loan data-- How can we predict whether a borrower will fully pay back their loan?
The goal is to create a model that will help classify and predict this.

The whole project includes below sections:

- Exploratory Data Analysis: explore relationship between variables with visualization plots using histogram, countplot, jointplot and lmplot.
- Data Wrangling: in order to fit in decision tree model, we need to transform categorical features using dummy variables 
- Decision Tree Model
1. Training and Testing Data
2. Training the Model
3. Predict with Test Data
4. Model Evaluation: classification_report
- Random Forest Model
